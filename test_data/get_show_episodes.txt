So we looked for a solution and ended up doing a text interview instead. Then I got Patrick McCorry (@paddypisa on Twitter) to speak the part of DS in the final recording, while I spoke my own part.

    "description" : "Today, I brought on Dan Robinson and Georgios Konstantopoulos, who are both research partners at Paradigm. Together, we explore the topic of MEV, or “Miner Extractable Value”. Blockchains like Ethereum have this dirty little secret that, while in most regards they are very decentralized, the ordering of transactions within a single block is actually completely in the hands of a single miner. They can insert their own transactions, rearrange those of users, or even censor them completely. MEV describes how much value a miner can extract from users and other miners by using these powers to their advantage. If you’ve never looked into MEV before, I think you’ll be both shocked and fascinated by the complexity and sophistication of the war that’s raging inside Ethereum’s memory pool.

My co-host is Tarun Chitra, the CEO and founder of Gauntlet, a company that helps stress test the incentive structures and economics of cryptocurrency protocols, especially of DeFi protocols. In this episode, we explore governance in Yearn in particular and how governance in DeFi should work in general. What roles exist, and how can we align their incentives? Is governance a feature to be tokenized and sold off, or an attack vector to be closed? How does the price of a governance token affect the security of its parent protocol?
